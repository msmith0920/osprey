"""Guard that the shipped app templates remain a known, fixed set.

The build pipeline accepts any directory under ``templates/apps/`` as a
``data_bundle``; preset coverage is driven by ``list_presets()`` reflection.
This test pins the on-disk set so that adding/removing an app bundle is an
explicit, reviewed change — and so that preset-parametrized tests stay in
sync with what actually ships.
