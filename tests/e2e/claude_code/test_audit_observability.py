"""E2E test: Natural workflow + Audit observability.

Consolidates the execute functional tests and audit verification into
a single test that exercises the natural user workflow:
  channel_find → archiver_read → execute (plot) → PNG artifact

Then verifies that Claude Code native transcripts contain the expected OSPREY
tool-call events and (optionally) lifecycle events (read via TranscriptReader).

Requires:
- Claude Code CLI installed
- claude_agent_sdk Python package installed
- ANTHROPIC_API_KEY environment variable set
