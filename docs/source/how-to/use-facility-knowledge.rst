==================
Facility Knowledge
==================

The Facility Knowledge system gives the OSPREY agent on-demand access to
structured narrative knowledge about your facility — subsystems, devices,
operational procedures, physics notes, and facility-specific references.

It uses a two-altitude model:

* ``facility.md`` — always loaded into the agent's context; contains only
  stable **identity** information (facility name, type, mission).
* **OKF bundle** — a directory of markdown concept documents; content is
  fetched on demand via ``list_concepts``, ``read_concept``, and ``search``
  tools exposed by the ``osprey_facility_knowledge`` MCP server.

This keeps the agent's context window lean for routine tasks while making
the full knowledge base available whenever the agent (or you) needs it.


How It Works
============

The ``osprey_facility_knowledge`` MCP server reads an OKF bundle at startup.
The bundle is a directory tree of markdown files with YAML frontmatter.
Each file is a *concept document* describing one topic (a subsystem,
a device class, an operational procedure, etc.).

.. code-block:: text

   data/facility_knowledge/
   ├── index.md                      ← bundle root index (auto-generated)
   ├── subsystems/
   │   ├── index.md                  ← sub-directory index (auto-generated)
   │   ├── power-supply-system.md
   │   └── timing-system.md
   ├── devices/
   │   ├── index.md
   │   └── magnet-power-supply.md
   └── procedures/
       ├── index.md
       └── beam-startup.md

The agent can:

* ``list_concepts`` — browse the index to discover what topics exist
* ``read_concept`` — retrieve a specific document by its bundle-relative path
* ``search`` — full-text search across all concept documents
* ``draft_concept`` — author a new concept document (requires human approval)


Configuring the Bundle Path
===========================

Point the server at your bundle by adding a ``facility_knowledge`` block to
``config.yml``:

.. code-block:: yaml

   facility_knowledge:
     bundle_path: data/facility_knowledge

Relative paths are resolved against the directory containing ``config.yml``
(the project root).  For the ``control_assistant`` preset the example bundle
is scaffolded into ``data/facility_knowledge/`` automatically.  Replace the
example content with your own facility's documents.

.. note::

   The bundle path is required.  If it is missing or the directory does not
   exist, the ``osprey_facility_knowledge`` server will refuse to start with
   a clear error message.


Authoring Concept Documents
============================

Each concept document is a markdown file with YAML frontmatter at the top:

.. code-block:: markdown

   ---
   type: subsystem
   title: Power Supply System
   description: DC power supplies for all storage-ring magnets.
   tags: [magnets, power-supplies, PSS]
   ---

   # Power Supply System

   ...document body...

Required frontmatter fields (authoring level):

+------------------+-------------------------------------------------------+
| Field            | Description                                           |
+==================+=======================================================+
| ``type``         | Document type — see conventional types below          |
+------------------+-------------------------------------------------------+
| ``title``        | Human-readable title                                  |
+------------------+-------------------------------------------------------+
| ``description``  | One-sentence summary used in indexes and search       |
+------------------+-------------------------------------------------------+

Conventional ``type`` values (free-form, but the following are recommended
for consistent index grouping):

* ``Subsystem`` — major facility subsystem (power supply, timing, vacuum…)
* ``Device`` — a device class or family of hardware components
* ``Procedure`` — operational procedure or checklist
* ``PhysicsNote`` — accelerator/beam physics explanation
* ``Reference`` — external document pointer, standard, or glossary entry

Optional fields: ``tags`` (list of strings), ``related`` (list of
bundle-relative paths to related docs).

Cross-links between documents use bundle-relative paths:

.. code-block:: markdown

   See [Timing System](/subsystems/timing-system.md) for synchronisation details.


.. _regenerating-indexes:

Regenerating Indexes
====================

Index files (``index.md`` in each directory) are generated automatically
from the concept documents they contain.  After adding or removing concept
documents, regenerate them via the Python API:

.. code-block:: python

   from osprey.services.facility_knowledge.okf.index import regenerate_indexes
   from pathlib import Path

   regenerate_indexes(Path("data/facility_knowledge"))

The root ``index.md`` includes an ``okf_version`` frontmatter key; sub-directory
indexes contain no frontmatter (they are consumed by the server, not the agent
directly).

.. note::

   ``regenerate_indexes`` is idempotent — running it twice produces the same
   output.  It never touches concept documents, only index files.


Drafting Concepts from an Agent Session
========================================

The ``draft_concept`` tool lets you author new knowledge documents directly
from a conversation with the OSPREY agent.  Because it writes to your project's
knowledge bundle, it requires **human approval** before executing.

Example agent prompt:

.. code-block:: text

   Draft a concept document for the vacuum system interlock procedure —
   how to respond to a sudden pressure spike in sector 4.

The agent will call ``draft_concept`` with a proposed path, frontmatter, and
body.  You review and approve in the standard approval dialog; the document
is written into the bundle and the index is regenerated.


Replacing the Example Bundle
==============================

The ``control_assistant`` preset ships an Example Research Facility (ERF)
bundle under ``data/facility_knowledge/``.  To replace it with your own
facility's knowledge:

1. Delete the example concept documents (keep the directory structure as a
   guide, or start fresh).
2. Author concept documents for your facility's subsystems, devices,
   procedures, physics notes, and references.
3. Call ``regenerate_indexes(Path("data/facility_knowledge"))``
   (see :ref:`regenerating-indexes`) to rebuild the index files.
4. Update ``facility.md`` with your facility's name, type, and mission
   (the identity section at the top).

There is no required structure beyond the top-level directory.  Organise
sub-directories however makes sense for your facility.
