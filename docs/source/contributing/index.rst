Contributing to Osprey
======================

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the Osprey Framework. This guide covers environment setup, Git workflow, code standards, and community guidelines.

----

Environment Setup
-----------------

**Prerequisites:** Python 3.11+, Git, a GitHub account, and `uv <https://docs.astral.sh/uv/>`_.

**1. Fork and Clone**

.. code-block:: bash

   git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/osprey.git
   cd osprey

**2. Install Dependencies**

.. code-block:: bash

   # Install all dev and docs dependencies (creates .venv automatically)
   uv sync --extra dev --extra docs

   # Add a new dependency
   uv add <package>

**3. Set Up Pre-commit Hooks**

.. code-block:: bash

   pre-commit install

Hooks auto-fix formatting and prevent commits with common problems.

**4. Verify Installation**

.. code-block:: bash

   uv run pytest tests/ --ignore=tests/e2e -v

If all tests pass, you are ready to contribute.

Git and GitHub Workflow
-----------------------

Branch Strategy
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Osprey follows **GitHub Flow**: a single long-lived branch (``main``) with
short-lived topic branches that PR back into it. Releases are CalVer tags
(``vYYYY.M.P``) on ``main`` — no separate release branch.

**What this means for contributors:**

- Branch your work off ``main``, and open your PR against ``main``.
- ``main`` is always the integration target. CI gates every PR; protected status checks must pass before merge.
- Releases are cut by maintainers tagging a commit on ``main``; the PyPI publish workflow runs on ``v*.*.*`` tags.
- Hotfixes follow the same path: branch from the tag (or ``main``), PR back, tag again as ``vYYYY.M.P+1``. No special hotfix branches.

Branch Naming
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- ``feature/description`` -- New features
- ``fix/description`` -- Bug fixes
- ``docs/description`` -- Documentation
- ``refactor/description`` -- Code refactoring
- ``test/description`` -- Test improvements

Making Changes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**1. Create a branch:**

.. code-block:: bash

   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name

**2. Make changes** -- follow the code standards below, add tests, update docs.

**3. Test locally** using the three-tier system:

.. code-block:: bash

   # Tier 1: Quick check (< 30s) -- before every commit
   ./scripts/quick_check.sh

   # Tier 2: Full CI check (2-3 min) -- before pushing
   ./scripts/ci_check.sh

   # Tier 3: Pre-merge check -- before creating a PR (compare against your PR target)
   ./scripts/premerge_check.sh main

**4. Commit changes** using conventional commit format:

.. code-block:: bash

   git add .
   git commit -m "feat(scope): short description

   - Detail about what changed
   - Another detail"

Commit Message Format
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- ``feat:`` -- New features
- ``fix:`` -- Bug fixes
- ``docs:`` -- Documentation
- ``refactor:`` -- Code refactoring
- ``test:`` -- Tests
- ``chore:`` -- Dependencies, build

Every commit needs a corresponding CHANGELOG entry added **before** committing.

Pull Request Process
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

1. Push your branch: ``git push origin feature/your-feature-name``
2. Open a PR on GitHub with a description, related issues, and testing performed.
3. PR requirements: pass all required CI checks, include a ``CHANGELOG.md`` entry for any user-visible change, and add appropriate tests. Internal-mode contributors with push access self-merge after CI is green (the ruleset does not require human approval); fork-mode contributions wait for a maintainer to merge.
4. During review: respond to feedback promptly, make requested changes, ask questions if unclear.

Branch Protection on ``main``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Direct pushes to ``main`` are rejected. All changes land via PR. The ruleset
enforces:

- All required CI checks must pass (no admin bypass).
- Linear history (use ``gh pr merge --rebase``; merge commits are rejected).
- Force-pushes and branch deletion on ``main`` are denied.

If a required check turns out to be wrong, fix it forward — there is no
escape hatch.

Osprey Agent Workflow Skill
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If you use the Osprey agent (e.g., via `Claude Code <https://docs.claude.com/en/docs/claude-code>`_),
install the bundled ``osprey-contribute`` skill to get guided help following
this workflow:

.. code-block:: bash

   uv run osprey skills install osprey-contribute

The skill walks you through branching, commits, push, PR, and CI iteration,
auto-detecting whether you have push access to ``als-apg/osprey`` or are
contributing from a fork. It composes with the other bundled skills:

- ``osprey-pre-commit`` -- standalone validation runs
- ``commit-organize`` -- splits a messy working tree into atomic commits
- ``osprey-release`` -- the release-cutting flow for maintainers
- ``osprey-design-philosophy`` -- OSPREY's design and architecture principles,
  for designing or reviewing a feature before you open the PR

List all installable skills with ``uv run osprey skills install --help``.

----

Code Standards
--------------

Design Principles
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Before designing a new connector, MCP server, provider, capability, or any
non-trivial feature, consult OSPREY's design and architecture principles -- the
safe-state default, facility-neutral core, measured symmetry with peer
subsystems, swappable components, and discoverable user-facing features.
Install the bundled skill so the Osprey agent applies them as you design and
review:

.. code-block:: bash

   uv run osprey skills install osprey-design-philosophy

The principles guide decisions; they are not mechanical rules. When a change
feels wrong but the reason is hard to name, they help you name the drift and
correct it before you open the PR.

Python Style
^^^^^^^^^^^^

We follow PEP 8 with Ruff enforcement:

- **Line length**: 100 characters
- **Type hints**: Gradual typing enforced with mypy
- **Docstrings**: Google style
- **Classes**: PascalCase, **Functions**: snake_case, **Constants**: UPPER_SNAKE_CASE

**Import organization:** standard library, then third-party, then local (``from osprey...``).

Linting and Formatting
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. code-block:: bash

   # Lint and format
   uv run ruff check src/ tests/
   uv run ruff format src/ tests/

   # Auto-fix lint issues
   uv run ruff check --fix src/ tests/

   # Type checking
   uv run mypy src/

Testing
^^^^^^^

All new functionality must include tests.

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 20 40 40

   * - Type
     - When to Use
     - Cost/Speed
   * - **Unit**
     - Pure functions, business logic, utilities
     - Fast, no external dependencies
   * - **Integration**
     - Component interactions, API endpoints
     - Medium
   * - **E2E**
     - Critical user flows, deployment validation
     - Slow, requires API keys ($0.10-$0.25/run)

**Running tests:**

.. code-block:: bash

   # Unit tests (fast, no API keys required)
   uv run pytest tests/ --ignore=tests/e2e -v

   # Single test file
   uv run pytest tests/path/to/test_file.py -v

   # Single test function
   uv run pytest tests/path/to/test_file.py::test_function_name -v

   # E2E tests (requires API keys) -- MUST use path, NOT marker
   uv run pytest tests/e2e/ -v

   # With coverage
   uv run pytest tests/ --ignore=tests/e2e --cov=src/osprey

.. warning::

   E2E tests **must** be run with ``pytest tests/e2e/`` not ``pytest -m e2e``.
   The marker-based approach causes registry state leaks and service conflicts.

Docstrings
^^^^^^^^^^

All public functions, classes, and methods need Google-style docstrings:

.. code-block:: python

   def capability_function(param1: str, param2: int) -> bool:
       """Short description of function.

       Args:
           param1: Description of first parameter.
           param2: Description of second parameter.

       Returns:
           Description of return value.

       Raises:
           ValueError: When parameter is invalid.
       """
