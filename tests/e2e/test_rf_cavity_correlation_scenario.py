"""End-to-end test for the RF-cavity-C1 thermal-excursion scenario.

Operator-style prompt — one diagnostic imperative, one deliverable, no
subsystem hints:

    "The beam dumped this morning. Figure out what happened and plot the data."

This is the cross-paradigm benchmark's RF scenario. It tests whether the
agent can, from a bare beam-dump report, (a) enumerate the canonical
suspects for unplanned beam loss (RF trip / vacuum event / magnet fault /
etc.) without being told, (b) discover and retrieve the relevant telemetry
for each suspect, (c) commit to a single cavity (C1 / device 01) as the
fault source based on the telemetry signature, and (d) name the mechanism
(thermal detuning → reflected-power spike → forward-power trip).

A multi-day logbook arc is seeded for cross-source enrichment:
DEMO-026 (trip) → DEMO-027 (investigation identifying cooling-manifold
blockage) → DEMO-028 (manifold flush repair). The logbook seed dates are
re-anchored at ``osprey build`` time so the most recent entry lands two
days before today (see ``rebase_logbook_timestamps`` in
``src/osprey/cli/templates/scaffolding.py``). The archiver pattern is
window-relative: the three C1 excursions appear at normalized positions
(t=0.20, 0.55, 0.85) in any window the agent chooses, so the test is
date-agnostic.

The agent must:

1. Decompose "beam dumped" into the canonical subsystem suspects and
   dispatch parallel investigations (the CLAUDE.md template guides this).
2. Discover RF cavity + DCCT + vacuum-gauge channel addresses via
   channel-finder.
3. Pull a sensible time window via ``mcp__controls__archiver_read`` for
   both cavities (so it can contrast C1 against C2) and at least DCCT.
4. Produce a plot via the data-visualizer subagent showing the correlated
   excursions on C1 with C2 stable for reference.
5. Identify cavity C1 (not C2) as the source and name the thermal-detuning
   mechanism.
