"""Statistical contract for the control_assistant simulation scenarios.

The e2e scenario tests (``test_vacuum_burst_scenario``,
``test_rf_cavity_correlation_scenario``) grade agent *diagnoses* with an LLM
judge; those diagnoses are only reachable if the synthesized data carries the
documented signatures. This file pins the signatures deterministically (no
LLM, fast) so the expensive e2e judge layers run against a known-good data
substrate. If a contract here fails, the fix is to tune ``machine.json``
amplitudes/widths — never to weaken the e2e prompts.

Signatures pinned (target value -> asserted threshold, with margin):

- ``vacuum-burst``: SR07 vs DCCT Pearson r ~= -0.89 (assert <= -0.75) in a
  10-min window straddling 14:32:08; SR07 is the single most anti-correlated
  sector, leading the runner-up by ~0.7 (assert separation > 0.3 — robust to
  the noise tail, unlike an absolute |r| bound); SR07 spike ~4x baseline;
  DCCT dips ~5 mA.
- ``rf-thermal``: C1 temperature excursions near window fractions
  0.20/0.55/0.85 (peaks 32-36 degC, assert > 31 over base 27); C2 stays
  quiet (~28.5 degC, assert < 29.5, far below the C1 excursions); C1
  reflected power tracks temperature (r ~= 0.96, assert > 0.8); derived
  POWER:NET tracks FWD-REV (r ~= 0.998, assert > 0.95); FREQUENCY:RB detunes
  downward during the excursions.
