Run Open & Local Models
=======================

OSPREY is built so the volatile pieces — the model and the agent harness — can be
swapped without touching the framework. This guide covers what already works
today: running the Osprey agent on **open-weight and locally hostable models**.

Two independent axes
--------------------

- **The agent harness** (the program that drives the model through tool calls) is
  swappable in *intent*. Today there is one, Claude Code; support for additional
  coding-agent harnesses is planned.
- **The model** is already swappable. The Osprey agent speaks the Anthropic
  Messages API; any OpenAI-protocol endpoint — remote or self-hosted — is reached
  through a local translation proxy that OSPREY starts automatically. Open models
  are a configuration choice, not a code change.

How open models are routed
--------------------------

Open models are most often served behind an **OpenAI-compatible** API — that is how
CBORG, Ollama, and vLLM all expose them — while the Osprey agent emits **Anthropic
Messages** calls. When the endpoint speaks the OpenAI protocol, OSPREY bridges the
two with a local ``Anthropic ↔ OpenAI`` translation proxy that starts automatically
once you select an OpenAI-protocol provider — you never invoke it yourself. This is
identical whether the model is self-hosted (``ollama``, ``vllm``, no API key) or
served by a remote aggregator. The provider list and ``config.yml`` keys are in
:doc:`configure-providers`.

Which models are known to work
------------------------------

For an agentic system "runs" means sustaining a multi-step tool-calling loop across
the **full OSPREY end-to-end suite**, not just emitting plausible text. The
following open families were verified to complete that suite end-to-end:

- ``gpt-oss`` (20B and 120B)
- ``gemma``
- ``cborg-coder``
- ``qwen-3`` / ``qwen-3-coder``

This set was chosen from the open models **available on the CBORG provider** — it
reflects CBORG's catalogue at benchmark time, not an exhaustive survey of open
models. Capability varies widely across the set; the snapshot below is the real
signal, not the bare "it runs" list.

Benchmark it yourself
---------------------

The numbers are reproducible. OSPREY ships the benchmark toolchain under
``scripts/benchmark/`` (see its ``README.md``): it runs the model-driving part of
``tests/e2e/`` — the tests that actually exercise the model under test — across a
matrix of models and renders a per-test pass-rate dashboard. The
whole run is declared in one file, ``scripts/benchmark/matrix.yaml`` — each row
names a ``provider`` and a model ``id``; the launcher resolves credentials,
derives the route (proxy for OpenAI-protocol models, direct for Anthropic),
wires the judge, and runs one isolated worker per (model, seed) cell. Adding a
model — or a provider like the local DeepSeek (``ds4``) server — is a config
edit, not a script edit.

.. code-block:: bash

   # see the resolved plan without running anything
   scripts/benchmark/matrix.py --dry-run

   # one model (substring filter), serially
   scripts/benchmark/matrix.py --only gpt-oss-20b --parallel 1

   # the whole grid, then render the dashboard
   scripts/benchmark/matrix.py --parallel 4
   scripts/benchmark/matrix_dashboard.py --results-dir results --out dashboard.html

The dashboard derives every count from the run data at render time — it never
hard-codes a number, so it stays honest as the suite grows.

.. admonition:: Benchmark snapshot — OSPREY 2026.6.1 (interim)
   :class: important

   Interim figures, measured against the current ``2026.6.1`` line — **not** the
   pinned ``v2026.6.2`` release run. They are provisional and will be replaced by
   a clean full-matrix re-run once ``v2026.6.2`` is tagged.

   - **Measured against:** OSPREY ``2026.6.1``
   - **Run:** 2026-06-25 · open subjects via CBORG, Anthropic reference columns via als-apg
   - **Scope:** the model-driving subset of ``tests/e2e/`` — 36 tests

   Pass rate per seed. Mean is over completed seeds.
