"""Framework-guard tests for projects with empty deployed_services.

The hello-world preset (and any future "agent-only" preset) declares no
deployed_services. Two failure modes have to stay fixed:

1. ``osprey build`` must still copy the root ``services/docker-compose.yml.j2``
   into the project, because the renderer references it unconditionally.
2. ``osprey deploy up`` must succeed (graceful no-op) instead of dying with
   ``TemplateNotFound`` mid-render.
