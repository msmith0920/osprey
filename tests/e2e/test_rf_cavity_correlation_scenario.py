"""End-to-end test for the RF-cavity-C1 thermal-excursion scenario.

Operator-style prompt — one diagnostic imperative, one deliverable, no
subsystem hints:

    "The beam dumped this morning. Figure out what happened and plot the data."

This is the cross-paradigm benchmark's RF scenario. It tests whether the
agent can, from a bare beam-dump report, (a) enumerate the canonical
suspects for unplanned beam loss (RF trip / vacuum event / magnet fault /
etc.) without being told, (b) discover and retrieve the relevant telemetry
for each suspect, (c) commit to a single cavity (C1 / device 01) as the
fault source based on the telemetry signature, and (d) name the mechanism
(thermal detuning → reflected-power spike → forward-power trip).

A multi-day logbook arc rides in the ``rf-thermal`` scenario bundle for
cross-source enrichment: DEMO-026 (trip) → DEMO-027 (investigation identifying
cooling-manifold blockage) → DEMO-028 (manifold flush repair). The bundle
carries these as *relative* timestamps (``when: {days_ago, time}``); applying
the scenario resolves them against one apply-time anchor (newest entry lands
two days before today) and seeds them into ARIEL. The telemetry ground truth
lives in the same bundle (``data/simulation/scenarios/rf-thermal/``): the three
C1 thermal excursions are declared at normalized window fractions (0.20, 0.55,
0.85), so they appear at those relative positions in any window the agent
chooses and the test stays date-agnostic. The test activates the scenario after
building the project via ``activate_scenarios(project, "rf-thermal")``, which
also purges + reseeds the logbook so narrative and telemetry share one clock;
the mock connectors then route RF cavity / klystron / DCCT reads through the
engine instead of the flat ``nominal`` default.

The agent must:

1. Decompose "beam dumped" into the canonical subsystem suspects and
   dispatch parallel investigations (the CLAUDE.md template guides this).
2. Discover RF cavity + DCCT + vacuum-gauge channel addresses via
   channel-finder.
3. Pull a sensible time window via ``mcp__controls__archiver_read`` for
   both cavities (so it can contrast C1 against C2) and at least DCCT.
4. Produce a plot via the data-visualizer subagent showing the correlated
   excursions on C1 with C2 stable for reference.
5. Identify cavity C1 (not C2) as the source and name the thermal-detuning
   mechanism.

    Tests the full puzzle:
        phenomenon → parallel investigation (logbook + telemetry) →
        channel discovery → archiver retrieval → visualization → root cause.

    Tool-trace assertions are the deterministic contract; the LLM judge
    layer guards against the agent fetching data but failing to name C1.

    The ARIEL logbook is seeded deterministically at setup by
    ``activate_scenarios(project, "rf-thermal")``: it purges and reseeds the DB
    from the scenario bundle so the cavity-C1 arc (DEMO-026/027/028) is present
    and matches the telemetry against one apply-time clock — no manual pre-seed,
    and no stale/wrong-preset DB to silently derail the agent. Needs a running
    ARIEL postgres (not provisioned on CI). See tests/e2e/README.md.

    Skipped on CI (no backend). Marked ``flaky(reruns=2)`` to absorb the rare
