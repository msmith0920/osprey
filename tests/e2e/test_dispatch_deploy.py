"""Full-stack Docker e2e for event dispatch (L2) — highest fidelity.

Unlike the subprocess sweep (``test_dispatch_tutorial.py``), this exercises the
REAL shipped artifacts: the compose templates, the bundled Dockerfile (which
installs Node + the Claude Code CLI the worker needs), the worker ``.env`` mount
that carries provider auth, and the in-network ``dispatch-worker-1:9190``
routing baked into the shipped ``tutorial_triggers.yml`` — none of which the
subprocess path touches.

It builds a control-assistant project, deploys the stack with
``osprey deploy up -d --dev``, fires all four tutorial webhooks at the dispatcher
(host-published on :8020), and asserts:

  * hello-dispatch / triage-event / save-report -> a run completes
  * denied-tool-demo -> rejected by the worker denylist (no completed run)

The worker receives its provider key via the project ``.env`` mounted at
``/app/project/.env`` (see the dispatch_worker compose template) — without that
wiring the agent run cannot authenticate, so this test also guards that mount.

Gating: needs Docker and ``ALS_APG_API_KEY``. We do NOT gate on a host
``claude`` binary — the CLI lives inside the built image, not on the runner.
