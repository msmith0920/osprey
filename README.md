**🎉 Latest Release: v2026.6.1** - Event dispatch & facility knowledge: turn external events into headless agent runs, serve subsystem knowledge on demand, plus composable data-driven simulation scenarios

> **🚧 Early Access Release**
> This is an early access version of the Osprey Framework. While the core functionality is stable and ready for experimentation, documentation and APIs may still evolve. We welcome feedback and contributions!

A production-ready framework for deploying agentic AI in large-scale, safety-critical control system environments—particle accelerators, fusion experiments, beamlines, and complex scientific facilities.

**📄 Research**
This work was presented as a contributed oral presentation at [ICALEPCS'25](https://indico.jacow.org/event/86/overview) and will be featured at the [Machine Learning and the Physical Sciences Workshop](https://ml4physicalsciences.github.io/2025/) at NeurIPS 2025.


## 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
# Install the framework as a standalone CLI tool (using uv, recommended)
uv tool install osprey-framework

# Create a minimal project to verify your setup
osprey build quickstart --preset hello-world
cd quickstart

# If API keys aren't already in your environment, copy and edit .env:
# cp .env.example .env

# Start a Claude Code agent session
claude
```

For a production project tailored to your detector, beamline, or accelerator
subsystem, install the guided osprey-build-interview skill and run it from Claude Code:

```bash
# Install the /osprey-build-interview skill into ~/.claude/skills/
uv run osprey skills install osprey-build-interview
```

Then start Claude Code in an empty directory and type `/osprey-build-interview`. The
skill walks you through a guided conversation, produces a build profile, and
`osprey build profile.yml` generates a ready-to-use project.

### 🧪 Testing

```bash
# Run unit tests (fast, no API keys required)
pytest tests/ --ignore=tests/e2e -v

# Run e2e tests (slow, requires API keys)
# ⚠️ IMPORTANT: Use 'pytest tests/e2e/' NOT 'pytest -m e2e'
pytest tests/e2e/ -v
```

See [tests/e2e/README.md](tests/e2e/README.md) and the [Contributing Guide](https://als-apg.github.io/osprey/contributing/) for details.


## Key Features

- **Agent-Driven Orchestration** - Skills, MCP tools, and explicit dependency declarations let the Osprey agent decompose operator requests into auditable steps with mandatory approval gates
- **Control-System Safety** - Pattern detection, PV boundary checking, and mandatory approval for hardware writes
- **Protocol-Agnostic Integration** - Seamless connection to EPICS, LabVIEW, Tango, and mock environments
- **Scalable Capability Management** - Dynamic classification prevents prompt explosion as toolsets grow
- **Production-Proven** - Deployed at major facilities including LBNL's Advanced Light Source accelerator
